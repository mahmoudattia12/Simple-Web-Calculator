## Frameworks and technology used:
- For the frontend part (view part), we used HTML, CSS, and typescript throw the angular framework.
- For the backend (model and controller), we used Java language throw the spring framework.
---
## How to run:
- Note: Make sure you downloaded NodeJs and Angular-CLI.
#### Backend part:
- Open the spring file on spring boot using IntelliJ ide, there will be 3 classes in the package, run them on port 8082 or you can change the port from the project resources → application.properties if the 8082 port was already used in your device.
#### Frontend part:
- Open the angular project file using visual studio ide, then open the terminal of the ide, and write npm install in the terminal.
- Then write “ng serve --open” in the terminal to open the project, on port “http://localhost:4200”.
